   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Yorick, a template tool for your projects
=========================================


Whenever you start a programming project (or a book, or anything you do that involves files on a computer), you often end up doing the same initial steps, without much variation.

Yorick allows you to automate this by creating "skeletons" - templates that you can "construct" to create a boilerplate project. In the process of constructing, a skeleton can prompt the user for variables (project name, for instance), and have those variables substituted appropriately into the skeleton.

A collection of skeletons for different types of projects is called a "closet". Yorick automatically gives you a default closet to keep all of your own skeletons in, and the ability to add other people's closets alongside it. You can keep your closet to yourself or open it up to the world on GitHub (a bit like dotfiles).
